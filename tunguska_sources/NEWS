Since alpha 2:
	* Assembler is less of a grammar nazi, allows uppercase labels.
	* Epic speed increase. Order of magnitude 50-100% speed boost.
	* New peripherial AGDP 'Auxiliary General Data Processor':
		o  12 trit floating point arithmetics
		o  Block operations
	* Bug fixes galore.
	* 3 color raster mode. Faster, but less versatile.
Since alpha 1:
	* Painting is done in a separate thread, which greatly
		boosts performance (especially for systems with multiple cores)
	* Reworked interrupt system (with queueing, instead of the old
		"chuck it over the shoulder" way of dealing with unwanted
		interrupts)
	* Assembler is nearly completetely rewritten to rely on flex and bison
		instead of the patchwork of code that was the old assembler. 
		The assembly syntax is also modified, to be hopefully 
		a lot clearer.
	* Rudimentary vector graphics!
	* Rudimentary raster graphics!
	* Mouse support
	* Fixes in a lot of previously defunct operations
	* Virtual floppydisk support
	* Zlib compression (output files are mostly zero anyways, so this will
	  reduce size potentially hundredfold)
